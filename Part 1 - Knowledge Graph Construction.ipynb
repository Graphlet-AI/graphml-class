    "Now we will use [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) via the [umap-learn](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html) PyPi library to reduce our data to 2 dimensions and then [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) [which workds with 2D data and infers circles aroud centrioids] via [scikit-learn]() to cluster it into journal names. Our final step is to nominate a real journal name for each cluster, which we will do manually as this course is about graph ML and this is NLP :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while normally you need to [standardize data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html#standardscaler) to give it a normal distribution with something like [sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), you do not need to do this when sentence encoding data with a sentence transformer as we have done.\n",

    "KMeans didn't work, which is probably because I didn't know how to tune it effectively, but DBSCAN is fairly automatic and produced good clusters, so I used that. If you think about it though, KMeans starts with random centroids... and that is why it is splitting journals."
