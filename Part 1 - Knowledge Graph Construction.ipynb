    "# Knowledge Graph Construction via Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) for a Simple, Natural Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start out by building a knowledge graph from an existing edge list and then add properties to it in a process called [Extract-Transform-Load or ETL](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/etl/) (some peope like [ELT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/Extract-Load-Transform-ELT), it's all the same to me). A common method of building an enterprise knowledge graph as a _property graph_ is to take a company's data on a platform like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.1/api/python/index.html#:~:text=PySpark%20is%20an%20interface%20for,data%20in%20a%20distributed%20environment.) [a Python interface to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/pyspark) is a popular [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS#:~:text=Platform%20as%20a%20service%20(PaaS,software%20on%20its%20own%20infrastructure.) solution for Spark and [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/), a [machine-learning operations (MLOps)](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops) platform] and ETL it into nodes and edges, each of which have properties. Then this data is loaded into a graph database like [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) for querying [[Neo4j Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/licensing/#neo4j-community-edition:~:text=About%20Neo4j%20Licenses-,Neo4j%20Community%20Edition,use%20Community%20Edition%2C%20whether%20or%20not%20your%20software%20is%20closed%20source.,-Download%20Neo4j%20%E2%86%92) is running on your machine right now via [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) if you're running this course]. We will demonstrate that process below using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [PyData](https://pydata.org/) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). We will also perform Natural Language Processing to create label for our nodes to use in Part 3 - Graph Analytics and Part 4 - Graph Machine Learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Citation graph edge list](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.txt.gz) contains node ID pairs. Node IDs are standard paper identifiers. This will build the core structure of our network.\n",

    "* [Publishing dates on arXiv](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh-dates.txt.gz) will make our citation network a temporal [Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) since one paper can't cite another before it is written and there are no reciprocal edges.

    "I'll be honest with you... I am a big data, large knowledge graph specialist. All the data we have used so far is very small to me. While it is difficult to cover scalable methods for everything, I wanted to introduce you to a tool for PySpark called [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html). It has some powerful utility methods like [connected components](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/user-guide.html#connected-components) that many teams use to perform tasks like merging nodes during entity resolution - node deduplication. It can also perform property graph [motif finding](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/user-guide.html#motif-finding) for networks with billions of nodes and edges.\n",
