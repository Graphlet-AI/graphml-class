    "# Knowledge Graph Construction via Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) for a Simple, Natural Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start out by building a knowledge graph from an existing edge list and then add properties to it in a process called [Extract-Transform-Load or ETL](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/etl/) (some peope like [ELT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/Extract-Load-Transform-ELT), it's all the same to me). A common method of building an enterprise knowledge graph as a _property graph_ is to take a company's data on a platform like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.1/api/python/index.html#:~:text=PySpark%20is%20an%20interface%20for,data%20in%20a%20distributed%20environment.) [a Python interface to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/pyspark) is a popular [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS#:~:text=Platform%20as%20a%20service%20(PaaS,software%20on%20its%20own%20infrastructure.) solution for Spark and [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/), a [machine-learning operations (MLOps)](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops) platform] and ETL it into nodes and edges, each of which have properties. Then this data is loaded into a graph database like [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) for querying [[Neo4j Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/licensing/#neo4j-community-edition:~:text=About%20Neo4j%20Licenses-,Neo4j%20Community%20Edition,use%20Community%20Edition%2C%20whether%20or%20not%20your%20software%20is%20closed%20source.,-Download%20Neo4j%20%E2%86%92) is running on your machine right now via [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) if you're running this course]. We will demonstrate that process below using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [PyData](https://pydata.org/) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). We will also perform Natural Language Processing to create label for our nodes to use in Part 3 - Graph Analytics and Part 4 - Graph Machine Learning.\n",

    "* [Publishing dates on arXiv](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh-dates.txt.gz) will make our citation network a temporal [Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) since one paper can't cite another before it is written and there are no reciprocal edges.

    "Now we will use [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) via the [umap-learn](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html) PyPi library to reduce our data to 2 dimensions and then [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) [which workds with 2D data and infers circles aroud centrioids] via [scikit-learn]() to cluster it into journal names. Our final step is to nominate a real journal name for each cluster, which we will do manually as this course is about graph ML and this is NLP :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while normally you need to [standardize data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html#standardscaler) to give it a normal distribution with something like [sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), you do not need to do this when sentence encoding data with a sentence transformer as we have done.\n",

    "\n",
    "KMeans didn't work, which is probably because I didn't know how to tune it effectively, but DBSCAN is fairly automatic and produced good clusters, so I used that. If you think about it though, KMeans starts with random centroids... and that is why it is splitting journals."

Sometimes node labels aren't cleanly available, and you have to work to get training data for graph machine learning. In Part 4 of this class we will use these labels with [PyG](https://pyg.org) to classify nodes with missing journal entries into the journals they belong to. Fun! :)"

Despite their dimension these correspond to superconformal theories with $c=9$ and so are perfectly good for compactifying the heterotic string to the four dimensions of space-time. As a check of mirror symmetry we compute the structure of the space of complex structures of the mirror and check that this reproduces the known results for the Yukawa couplings and metric appropriate to the Kahler class parameters on the Z orbifold together with their instanton corrections.',\n",

       " 'Abstract': 'We analyze the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds and their associated conformally invariant nonlinear sigma-models and show that they are described by an unexpectedly rich geometrical structure. Specifically, the Kahler sector of the moduli space of such Calabi-Yau conformal theories admits a decomposition into adjacent domains some of which correspond to the (complexified) Kahler cones of topologically distinct manifolds. These domains are separated by walls corresponding to singular Calabi-Yau spaces in which the spacetime metric has degenerated in certain regions. We show that the union of these domains is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of a single topological Calabi-Yau space---the mirror. In this way we resolve a puzzle for mirror symmetry raised by the apparent asymmetry between the Kahler and complex structure moduli spaces of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Furthermore, using mirror symmetry, we show that we can interpolate in a physically smooth manner between any two theories represented by distinct points in the Kahler moduli space, even if such points correspond to topologically distinct spaces. Spacetime topology change in string theory, therefore, is realized by the most basic operation of deformation by a truly marginal operator. Finally, this work also yields some important insights on the nature of orbifolds in string theory.',\n",

Using algebraic methods and mirror symmetry we study extensions of the mathematical notion of length (as specified by a K\\\\\\\"ahler structure) to conformal field theory and calculate the way in which lengths change as the moduli fields are varied along distinguished paths in the moduli space. We find strong evidence supporting the notion that, in the robust setting of quantum Calabi-Yau moduli space, string theory restricts the set of possible K\\\\\\\"ahler forms by enforcing ``minimal length'' scales, provided that topology change is properly taken into account. Some lengths, however, may shrink to zero. We also compare stringy geometry to classical general relativity in this context.\",\n",
