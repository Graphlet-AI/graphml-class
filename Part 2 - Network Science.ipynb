    "Having demonstrated _knowledge graph construction_ in Part 1, it is time to survey network science! Please keep in mind that as a vast and multidisciplinary field with papers covering many areas of science, network science is impossible to cover completely. What I will do is paint the broad strokes of tools common to many fields where network science is used to analyze and understand domain-specific networks.\n",

It is a resource where you can look up terms and techniques. [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/) [see his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si)] is a world-renowned expert who discovered [Scale Free Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network). Network Science provides more in-depth treatment of topics like [graph theory](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/2), [random networks](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/3) and [communities](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9), as well as many more.

It can rapidly compute expensive metrics compare to CPU, where processing is often limited to a single core. An NVIDIA GPU and cuGraph are optional in this course, but will be helpful as you use complex algorithms on large networks."

    "An average clustering coefficient of 0.16 in our `nx.DiGraph` implies there is a relatively low degree of clustering or tight-knit communities. It suggests a network structure that is more spread out, with fewer connections among immediate neighbors of each node. Networks such as web pages or citation networks often present lower clustering coefficients, as these networks are characterized by a wide range of diverse connections that do not necessarily link back to each other. Citation networks are actually temporal networks and are constrained by the fact that papers can't cite future papers, but only past ones. They are therefore DAGs - directed, acyclic graphs.\n",

It provides an indication of how the neighbors of a _particular node_ are interconnected. It measures how close a node's neighbors are to being a complete graph or a clique. It is defined as the fraction of possible triangles that exist through the node, or equivalently, as the fraction of the node's neighbors that are also neighbors of each other.\n",

    "Neither one of these fits the citation network very well. Some searching in the network science literature brings up this: Citation Graph Model. Wikipedia describes the first such model, Price's model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Price's model (named after the physicist Derek J. de Solla Price) is a mathematical model for the growth of citation networks.[1][2] It was the first model which generalized the Simon model[3] to be used for networks, especially for growing networks. Price's model belongs to the broader class of network growing models (together with the Barabási–Albert model) whose primary target is to explain the origination of networks with strongly skewed degree distributions. The model picked up the ideas of the Simon model reflecting the concept of rich get richer, also known as the Matthew effect. Price took the example of a network of citations between scientific papers and expressed its properties. His idea was that the way an old vertex (existing paper) gets new edges (new citations) should be proportional to the number of existing edges (existing citations) the vertex already has. This was referred to as cumulative advantage, now also known as preferential attachment. Price's work is also significant in providing the first known example of a scale-free network (although this term was introduced later). His ideas were used to describe many real-world networks such as the Web."

    "## More on Sampling Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "> Large-scale networks, seen in contexts like social media or bioinformatics, bring forth considerable computational challenges due to their size and complexity. Traditional algorithms and infrastructures often struggle to efficiently compute global network measures, visualize data, and manage inherent noise in these large datasets. Network sampling, which involves selecting a representative subset of the network, offers a way to alleviate these issues. It enables feasible computation and interpretation of network properties. However, creating effective sampling strategies is crucial to maintain the original network's key characteristics, ensuring accurate inferences about the larger system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major types of sampling a network: random sampling, snowball sampling and random walk sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random sampling selects random nodes from the network and includes edges between those nodes that are in the sample. This makes sense when your graph fits a random graph model like Erdos Reyni.\n",
    "- Snowball sampling creates an \"ego network\" which is centered on a single node of particular interest. It is useful when you want to investigate a region of a network. An ego (a node) may be of particular interest in the context of its alters (its neighbors) or a cluster or region of the graph may require your attention. Snowball sampling can \"zoom in\" to assist with visualization, which we will use below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Snowball Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the context of network science, a snowball sample is a method of data collection that uses a cascading or \"snowball\" effect to discover and analyze nodes in a network. It's often used when you don't have access to the entire network data, or when the network is too large to feasibly analyze in its entirety.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The process begins with a small set of \"seed\" nodes in the network. You identify all nodes that these seed nodes are directly connected to (i.e., their neighbors), and add them to your sample. This is often referred to as one \"hop\" or \"wave\" out from the seed nodes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But the process doesn't stop there, much like a snowball rolling down a hill and growing in size, you continue the process for these newly added nodes, finding all of their connected nodes, or neighbors, and adding them to your sample. This is the second hop, and you can continue this for as many \"hops\" as you want, each time expanding the number of nodes in your sample.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When we say \"1.5 hop\" in the context of a snowball sampling of a network, it typically means that we start from a certain node (or set of nodes), then we include all the direct neighbors of this node (that's the first \"hop\"), and then for the \"0.5\" hop, we also include nodes that are connected to the nodes in the first hop but not include their connections (i.e., not going another full hop further). The idea behind this is to gather a slightly wider view of the network around our starting point, but without expanding to the full 2-hop neighborhood, which could significantly increase the size of the sample.\n",
