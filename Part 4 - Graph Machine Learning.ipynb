    "\n",
    "The cluster sizes you've provided, derived from applying the Louvain Modularity algorithm on a citation graph of physics papers, represent the sizes of communities of papers that cite each other. The sizes are listed in descending order, indicating a few large clusters followed by many smaller ones. This pattern is typical in real-world networks and is often referred to as a scale-free or heavy-tailed distribution. Here are a few interpretations and insights based on this distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Community Structure - There are a few large communities of papers (e.g., the largest has 1909 papers) which likely represent major topics or fields within high energy physics. These large clusters suggest that there are common themes that have garnered significant attention and citation in the community.\n",
    "* Long Tail - As we move down the list, the cluster sizes decrease, forming a long tail of smaller communities. This indicates a wide variety of specialized or niche topics within the field that have smaller groups of papers citing each other.\n",
    "* Power-Law Distribution - The distribution of cluster sizes resembles a power-law distribution, which is common in many natural and social phenomena. In a power-law distribution, a few items (in this case, topics or fields) are exceptionally common, but the vast majority are rare.\n",
    "* Interdisciplinary or Emerging Areas - The smaller clusters may represent interdisciplinary or emerging areas of research that have not yet amassed a large number of citations.\n",
    "* Potential for Further Exploration - Understanding the thematic content of the large clusters could provide insights into the major areas of focus in high energy physics, while exploring the smaller clusters might reveal emerging or under-explored areas of research.\n",
    "* Rich-Get-Richer Phenomenon - The distribution may also reflect a \"rich-get-richer\" phenomenon where well-cited papers continue to accumulate more citations over time, reinforcing the prominence of certain topics.\n",
    "* Validation of Louvain Modularity - The distribution of cluster sizes could also serve as a validation of the Louvain Modularity algorithm's effectiveness in detecting community structure within the citation network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Featurizing Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "To featurize our communities, we need to assign numeric values to the clusters and append a column for cluster ID to `features`. Note, we could alternatively [one-hot-encode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) the features to give them one feature column per cluster. This would make the features sparse, which means lesss signal - something neural networks don't like but that another algorithm might not mind. We could use the [hashing trick](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html) - a method of feature engineering somewhere in between one-hot-encoding and neural embeddings. We are instead going to _label encode_ them with [sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html)."

    "\n",
    "[DGL or Deep Graph Library](https://dgl.ai) is the simplest way to get started with graph machine learning using graph neural networks (GNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will cover a few common operations with each major task type we covered in the lecture: node-level, edge-level, subgraph-level and graph-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node-Level Tasks: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Node-level tasks usually involve property prediction - classifying nodes into categories or regressing one of their numeric properties. We'll cover both.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the network science section of this course, we will start with a Text Attributed Graph (TAG) called a Citation Graph. We are going to use the [CORA dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA), [described by Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Introduced by Andrew McCallum et al. in [Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009953814988)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Cora dataset consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes. The citation network consists of 5429 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a 0/1-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. The dictionary consists of 1433 unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORA Node Features: Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Note... the features for this network are a [Bag of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model: simple and _sparse_ rather than modern text representations which are _dense_, distributed representations in the form of language models or [embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/meet-ais-multitool-vector-embeddings). Each node has a row in the feature matrix and each of 1,433 unique words get a column with the word count. Before [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) introduced text embeddings in 2013, the features for NLP problems were mostly 0s, with a few non-zero values.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) prevented NLP applications from realizing their modern capabilities - the more words that were added, the more dimensions the features data got and the more dimensions you add to a _sparse_ feature vector... the more all the values of that vector start to approximate the same value. They stretch out over many dimensions and look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings like Word2Vec related _sparse representations_ of words to the text around them by storing a middle layer of a neural network, creating _dense representations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/from_sparse_to_dense.webp\" width=\"700px\" alt=\"The Word2Vec's Skipgram architecture maps sparse to dense vectors via a shallow embedding technique\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are very useful because the dimensions of the feature vector correspond to particular semantics, and because you can compare two dense vectors and get a sense of how similar the objects the represent are. This is very useful for information retreival applications like search and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/king_minus_man_plus_woman.webp\" width=\"800px\" alt=\"Given the dense embedding vector for the word 'king', if we subtract the vector for 'man' and add 'woman', we arrive at a vector very close to 'queen'.\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use a language model or large language model (LLM) to embed the features or the original text and get better performance from our GCN. However, it is good to start simple and worry about feature engineering lately... you can spend an endless amount of time over optimizing a task nobody cares about. Make sure they want the prototype before you engineer incredible performance. A Bag of Words representation is a fine start.\n",
