    "The old-school method of machine learning that was common practice before graph embeddings and Graph Neural Networks was to hand engineer features of the nodes of a network by querying the network with `networkx` or a graph database like Neo4j using Cypher or Gremlin and to assign the results of those queries to nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cluster sizes you've provided, derived from applying the Louvain Modularity algorithm on a citation graph of physics papers, represent the sizes of communities of papers that cite each other. The sizes are listed in descending order, indicating a few large clusters followed by many smaller ones. This pattern is typical in real-world networks and is often referred to as a scale-free or heavy-tailed distribution. Here are a few interpretations and insights based on this distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Community Structure - There are a few large communities of papers (e.g., the largest has 1909 papers) which likely represent major topics or fields within high energy physics. These large clusters suggest that there are common themes that have garnered significant attention and citation in the community.\n",
    "* Long Tail - As we move down the list, the cluster sizes decrease, forming a long tail of smaller communities. This indicates a wide variety of specialized or niche topics within the field that have smaller groups of papers citing each other.\n",
    "* Power-Law Distribution - The distribution of cluster sizes resembles a power-law distribution, which is common in many natural and social phenomena. In a power-law distribution, a few items (in this case, topics or fields) are exceptionally common, but the vast majority are rare.\n",
    "* Interdisciplinary or Emerging Areas - The smaller clusters may represent interdisciplinary or emerging areas of research that have not yet amassed a large number of citations.\n",
    "* Potential for Further Exploration - Understanding the thematic content of the large clusters could provide insights into the major areas of focus in high energy physics, while exploring the smaller clusters might reveal emerging or under-explored areas of research.\n",
    "* Rich-Get-Richer Phenomenon - The distribution may also reflect a \"rich-get-richer\" phenomenon where well-cited papers continue to accumulate more citations over time, reinforcing the prominence of certain topics.\n",
    "* Validation of Louvain Modularity - The distribution of cluster sizes could also serve as a validation of the Louvain Modularity algorithm's effectiveness in detecting community structure within the citation network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Featurizing Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "To featurize our communities, we need to assign numeric values to the clusters and append a column for cluster ID to `features`. Note, we could alternatively [one-hot-encode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) the features to give them one feature column per cluster. This would make the features sparse, which means lesss signal - something neural networks don't like but that another algorithm might not mind. We could use the [hashing trick](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html) - a method of feature engineering somewhere in between one-hot-encoding and neural embeddings. We are instead going to _label encode_ them with [sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html)."
